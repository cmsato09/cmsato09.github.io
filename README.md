# Chris Sato's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! 

This project is my first time being completely dependent upon Copilot's Ask and Edit mode using GPT-4o. 
I want to compare this against the Copilot's Agent Mode. 

## Planning
A technical design document was written by Claude AI with the following input and constraints. 
- Static portfolio website with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Javascript to display my GitHub projects.
- Navbar with "About," "Projects," and "Skills" section
- Responsive page where it looks good on desktop and mobile.
- Project structure should have index.html, a css file, a javascript file, and images folder.

Additional points were needed since the original draft had mentions of using Tailwind CSS with `npm` and GitHub integration using GitHub APIs.
- Remove GitHub integrations
- Implement Tailwind CSS with CDN

## Execution
It was interesting to see what VS Code did with the Edit mode given the technical document.
I did have to implement things piece by piece. It was easier to control certain sections to create a 
skeleton HTML document for each section I was implementing. There were also times I used the Ask mode 
to figure out what certain Tailwind CSS syntax meant. I did change up the profile style
midway through and Copilot came up with something that I liked. 

Overall it was cool to implement and now I have a better web portfolio page!
